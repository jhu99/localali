Description
This file is README file of the package of LocalAli developed by Jialu Hu.
To guide you quickly starting to use our alignment tool, we structured this README into five parts:
1) PREREQUISITE
2) DOWNLOAD
3) COMPILING
4) OPTION
5) EXAMPLES
Before running this program, you are recommended to read this file carefully.
For easy to explain, we denote $LOCALALI as the path to LocalAli folder.

################################################################################
PREREQUISITE
1. LEMON Graph Library 1.2.3
The source code is freely available under Boost Software License, Version 1.0 at the website: http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/jhu/LocalAli/lemon-1.2.3.tar.gz
Please first compile the lemon graph library before compiling the code of LocalAli.
Note that this package should be moved to the directory $LOCALALI/include.
2. GoTermFinder
This package is necessary only if you want to use "-analyse" option to calculate p-Value of reported alignments.
It can be download at http://search.cpan.org/dist/GO-TermFinder/lib/GO/TermFinder.pm.

################################################################################
DOWNLOAD
1. Checkout the source code from the project's subversion repository
svn checkout http://localali.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ $LOCALALI

2. Download datasets and lemon-1.2.3
datsets: http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/jhu/LocalAli/dataset.tar.gz
lemon-1.2.3: http://ftp.mi.fu-berlin.de/jhu/LocalAli/lemon-1.2.3.tar.gz

Download the datasets into the folder $LOCALALI and uncompress it with command:
cd $LOCALALI
tar -zxvf dataset.tar.gz
Download lemon-1.2.3 into the folder $LOCALALI/include/ and uncompress it with command:
cd $LOCALALI/include
tar -zxvf lemon-1.2.3.tar.gz


################################################################################
COMPILING
The compiler g++-4.6 or higher is strongly recommended to compile the source code, but not limited to. Visual Studio 11 is also supported.
It can be done under Linux with several simple commands as follows:

1. Compile LEMON GRAPH LIBRARY

cd $LOCALALI/include/lemon-1.2.3/
./configure
./make
./make check 
./make install (you will need root privileges to be able to do that, but it's not necessary to install)

2. Compile LOCALALI

cd $LOCALALI
mkdir bin
./make MODE=Release
#If you want to compile it in Debug mode, run command:
./make (MODE=Debug)
#The binary code will be in the folder ./$LOCALALI/bin after compilation.

#if you want to compile it with other compilers such as g++-4.7, do it like this:
./make MODE=Release CXX=g++-4.7


################################################################################
OPTION
You can see the detailed option information with option "-h".
It is noted that there are two options you must specify if you want to run LOCALALI for an alignment task. They are described as follows:

1. -profile
The default file is "./profile.input", but you can also change the filename and path by "-profile" option.
This file tells the program where to find the input files.
It is expected to be in two-column tab-delimited format.
These lines starting with "#" will be seen as comments.
Each line has one keyword and one value, like this:
$keyword	$value
Using this file, you are allowed to set keywords (folder species layers tree) here.

For example:

--------------BEGIN OF PROFILE--------------
folder ./dataset/3-way/
species Celeg20130707
species Dmela20130707
species Scere20130707
layers  input_blast.txt
tree    tree.txt
--------------END OF PROFILE--------------

The specified filenames which are needed by localali would be:
./dataset/3-way/Celeg201300707-int.txt
./dataset/3-way/Dmela20130707-int.txt
./dataset/3-way/Scere20130707-int.txt
./dataset/3-way/input_blast.txt
./dataset/3-way/tree.txt

Interactions of each species are in three-column tab-delimited format (INTERACTOR_A INTERACTOR_B score) as follows (the third column is not necessary):
--------------BEGIN OF NETWORK--------------
DIP-1016N       DIP-250N        0.9
DIP-244N        DIP-1016N       0.9
DIP-1014N       DIP-926N        0.9
DIP-25958N      DIP-25445N      0.9
DIP-25958N      DIP-24681N      0.9
DIP-26515N      DIP-25958N      0.9
DIP-25958N      DIP-25384N      0.9
DIP-27373N      DIP-24569N      0.9
DIP-24673N      DIP-24569N      0.9
DIP-24569N      DIP-24676N      0.9
--------------END OF NETWORK--------------

The layered graph will be constructed through these homologous proteins. The third column is evalue but bit-score is also supported.
--------------BEGIN OF HOMOLOGY--------------
DIP-24593N      DIP-5N  8e-14
DIP-24593N      DIP-5N  2e-10
DIP-24593N      DIP-5N  4e-08
DIP-24797N      DIP-5N  3e-08
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  2e-29
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  4e-27
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  1e-24
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  4e-24
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  2e-23
DIP-25131N      DIP-5N  9e-22
--------------END OF HOMOLOGY--------------
